1
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.849
Brady Lund: All right. Welcome everyone to Module 3

2
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:20.890
Brady Lund: this week. We're going to talk about some of the basic concepts of information science. And then you'll see in the module for this week we have our 1st assignment, so after I go through our few slides here.

3
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.180
Brady Lund: I will go ahead and

4
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:31.270
Brady Lund: provide a bit of an overview of the upcoming assignment. So you know what to expect and what you need to do in that assignment.

5
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.060
Brady Lund: So, as I said this week we're talking about some of the basic concepts of information science. So

6
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.680
Brady Lund: what is the scope? The breadth of everything contained within this discipline of ours?

7
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.860
Brady Lund: So the 1st thing to know about information science is obviously that

8
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.280
Brady Lund: we deal with information. But what is information?

9
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.079
Brady Lund: So this is a pretty popular diagram here.

10
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:11.339
Brady Lund: used in a variety of different disciplines, but we use it in information, science as well, and it shows the relationship

11
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:20.030
Brady Lund: between 4 different concepts, data, information, knowledge and wisdom. It's called the DIKW. Pyramid.

12
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.769
Brady Lund: and it's really a useful diagram to help understand our particular field.

13
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.290
Brady Lund: So in the world, in our experience. We are regularly encountering data

14
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:50.130
Brady Lund: data being raw facts, symbols, inputs, things that we can sense and feel about the world around us. So if we can sense light from a from a ceiling light hitting us. Then we're receiving some kind of stimulus. We're sensing something.

15
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.039
Brady Lund: and that is some form of data. If we look at a list of different numbers or words. That is data.

16
00:01:58.906 --> 00:01:59.979
Brady Lund: It's raw.

17
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:08.820
Brady Lund: We don't have any meaning to it yet. We don't know what it means. But we are sensing something. There is something out in the world that can be sensed.

18
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.080
Brady Lund: Information, then.

19
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:20.229
Brady Lund: is applying meaning to the data around us. So when we talk about information, we're talking about data, this stimulus, this

20
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.999
Brady Lund: everything in the world around us.

21
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:34.390
Brady Lund: but applying some kind of meaning to us, understanding what it means. Why is this here? What is this collection of words? Is it a a book? Is it a poem?

22
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.019
Brady Lund: So on and so forth?

23
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.800
Brady Lund: And so you can see the example on the right here, you know, raw, you sense the color red

24
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.480
Brady Lund: meaning you've applied some context or meaning to it. So

25
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.320
Brady Lund: information. You learn that it's a traffic light

26
00:02:50.920 --> 00:03:07.320
Brady Lund: knowledge, apply more context and understanding to what information you've gathered, and essentially taking information and applying it to another context. So in the example, here, the traffic light you're driving towards has turned red.

27
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:19.950
Brady Lund: In the case of reading a book or a poem, you're learning something from that book or poem that can be applied outside of the context, that you read it in that book or poem.

28
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:30.230
Brady Lund: And then wisdom is applying knowledge. So in this case wisdom is, I better stop the car. But in the case of reading a book, maybe you've read how to

29
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.780
Brady Lund: fix your washing machine.

30
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:45.280
Brady Lund: and the knowledge is the new knowledge of fixing the washing machine. But wisdom is actually applying that knowledge to do something with it. So when we talk about information science, we're

31
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.100
Brady Lund: primarily talking about either taking data

32
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.949
Brady Lund: and making sense of it. So making information out of data by doing analyses and those kinds of things.

33
00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:05.630
Brady Lund: We're taking information and turning it into knowledge by organizing it by arranging it so people can find the information they need, and then apply that into knowledge. So we work

34
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.800
Brady Lund: kind of in between these different realms here, facilitating the process of turning data to information, to knowledge and so forth.

35
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.839
Brady Lund: So what is a document.

36
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:35.280
Brady Lund: Well, a document is a specific form of information. It is a specific record that stores data or information. So a document can be printed or digital. We have word documents that are digital on our computer. We have print documents, we have documents that are like notebooks, right?

37
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.459
Brady Lund: And that is documented information.

38
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.920
Brady Lund: So that is one form

39
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:49.490
Brady Lund: of recorded information. Obviously, we could have other forms of recorded information like audio files videos.

40
00:04:49.880 --> 00:05:11.429
Brady Lund: But this is one important type of document because it provides a stable and constant record. So if we're talking about working in records management, if we're talking about working in a library situation, we're dealing primarily but not exclusively, with documents written work. We don't have the actual

41
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:25.900
Brady Lund: author of this work there in the library to speak to us and ask questions to. We don't have always a recording of them, but we have these documents that have recorded the information that they thought was important to share.

42
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:51.400
Brady Lund: Documents can contain structured or unstructured data or information. So if I've organized my information into a book, obviously, it's structured information. If I've organized a data sheet and created analyses and things that's structured data. But it could just contain random words, facts, figures that are unorganized as well, and it still qualifies as a document.

43
00:05:51.500 --> 00:06:00.309
Brady Lund: So again, some examples of that books, articles, the actual physical movies that have information about the movie data sets.

44
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.780
Brady Lund: emails.

45
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:11.599
Brady Lund: So some some common questions thinking about this definition of a document. It needs to be a record that stores and communicates some kind of data or information

46
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.559
Brady Lund: are text documents like phone text are those documents?

47
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.659
Brady Lund: Consider that they are. That

48
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:34.010
Brady Lund: text exchange is stored right? In that case it's a digital record. If you were to text and immediately delete the text. Then it was at a point in time a document that has since been deleted.

49
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:41.160
Brady Lund: and then some of the more curious questions within information science

50
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.550
Brady Lund: would be something like our elephants documents.

51
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:55.940
Brady Lund: In the time that elephants are alive they store and communicate some kind of data. Right? You can sense things about elephants. You can understand something about elephants by observing them

52
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.450
Brady Lund: by looking at the features of them.

53
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:06.640
Brady Lund: But they're not what we'd call a traditional document, right? We think of a document as like a piece of paper or a document on our computer.

54
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:18.419
Brady Lund: But according to the definition in the extent that an elephant can communicate something by you, sensing it and understanding it in a physical form, it could be considered a document.

55
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.060
Brady Lund: So what is a library?

56
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:40.429
Brady Lund: Some of you will be in this program because you're interested in librarianship. So of course, you're working in libraries, physical libraries. But libraries can be digital as well and pretty much regardless of what job you're going to do in information science, you're going to work with some kind of digital library, right? Database of resources.

57
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:46.559
Brady Lund: So even if you're working in systems management. You're going to be working with digital libraries

58
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:55.510
Brady Lund: and libraries are simply just repositories for documents. So we've worked up our different levels. We started in the Dikw saying, what is information?

59
00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:14.060
Brady Lund: Where I defined information as data that has meaning? A document is a recorded information so recorded in a physical or digital format. And we're saying, libraries are repositories for documents. So when we have a lot of documents stored together, we have a library.

60
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:20.790
Brady Lund: and they do not just store documents. We don't just throw a bunch of documents in a in a pile.

61
00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:34.669
Brady Lund: but we need some kind of organizational system to logically support the arrangement and help people find the resources they need. So that's a key aspect of a library. Again, regardless of the format of the library.

62
00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:43.169
Brady Lund: So libraries of various types have existed for thousands of years, really, but only in their

63
00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:56.569
Brady Lund: current form that we see today in the past couple of centuries. But before that we always had some kind of storage for documents, important government documents, religious documents, and so forth. So you can study libraries going back.

64
00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.680
Brady Lund: millennia in that format.

65
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:12.750
Brady Lund: The last thing we're going to really talk about here is, how do we interact with information? We're going to talk about this more as we progress through the semester. But let's talk about a few of the main ways that we interact with information.

66
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:24.939
Brady Lund: Well, one way is we create information. We create information. When we're interacting with information in the world around us. When we talk to people, we're sharing information. That's not a document

67
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:32.550
Brady Lund: because we're talking. There's no permanent record of it. But we're still sharing information, and we record things within documents.

68
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:39.619
Brady Lund: We also organize information. So we put some kind of structure to it. So people can come back and find it at a later date.

69
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:58.730
Brady Lund: We retrieve information. So we don't just put information in these libraries and store these records. But we're doing that. So people can come along and find the information they need, retrieve it and use it right. And that's the next step using information. So we use information. Information does not just exist out there.

70
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:09.960
Brady Lund: but information exists for the purpose of us being able to go back and use it. If there was no use to the information. If there was no meaning to the information, then it's not information. It's just data, right?

71
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.880
Brady Lund: And then preservation of information.

72
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.039
Brady Lund: We recognize that even if certain forms of information, certain

73
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.119
Brady Lund: content of information may not be super relevant to us right now.

74
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:36.330
Brady Lund: or even if it is relevant to us right now it may continue to have relevance or may develop future relevance. And so we preserve information in a variety of forms so that people can access it at a future date.

75
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.380
Brady Lund: So that is the content that we're talking about this week.

76
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:56.579
Brady Lund: And now let's talk briefly about our assignment for this week. So our assignment this week is called What is information science. And you have 2 options for this assignment. Please only pick one of the 2 options. You do not need to do both.

77
00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:04.940
Brady Lund: Pick one of these 2 options. So you're going to present some information about the important concept

78
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:14.430
Brady Lund: or figure, person or organization related to information science, the early development of information science.

79
00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:22.280
Brady Lund: So your 1st step is to identify what topic you use. So there's a variety of different topics you can choose from.

80
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:44.120
Brady Lund: If you can think of another topic you're interested in, please email me, I will probably approve it. But I do want to take a look just to make sure it's relevant. So send me an email so we can determine that it's relevant to what we're talking about this week or select one of these topics here that are individuals and concepts that are important to the basis of information science.

81
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.540
Brady Lund: Once you've selected the topic.

82
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:53.860
Brady Lund: then you're going to make a choice about whether you want to do a 10 min recorded Powerpoint presentation

83
00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:58.799
Brady Lund: or a thousand word research paper. So the choice is totally yours.

84
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.050
Brady Lund: There are, of course, benefits and drawbacks to both.

85
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:25.600
Brady Lund: With the Powerpoint presentation you need to create 8 slides, and then you need to record yourself for 10 min presenting those slides. And I provide information here about what you need to include in each slide and the grading criteria for each of those sections. Make sure it's visually appealing. Make sure it lasts at least 10 min. Make sure it has the number of slides you need.

86
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:35.269
Brady Lund: So 10 slow total, with 8 of the slides, including a image or visualization of some sort. So 10 slides total.

87
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.459
Brady Lund: Make sure it has all of those elements.

88
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.460
Brady Lund: If you choose a research paper. It's a thousand word paper.

89
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.979
Brady Lund: Make sure you include the title page in a reference list.

90
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.450
Brady Lund: and then you provide an overview in the same way you might with the Powerpoint.

91
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:56.200
Brady Lund: In either case, make sure you do your own research.

92
00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:03.589
Brady Lund: make sure you include some references to scholarly resources that you found the information from

93
00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:33.760
Brady Lund: make sure to avoid plagiarism and AI use. I do have a variety of tricks and ways of determining whether you use AI. I am an AI researcher. So I actually spend a fair bit of time studying different strategies to catch people using AI which could be pretty embarrassing if you get caught. So please make sure to avoid it

94
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:50.300
Brady Lund: again. It's a 10 min Powerpoint presentation or a thousand word research paper. The goal is to see you start to develop some knowledge and competency related to one specific concept. You can see there's some we've talked about like the dikw pyramid.

95
00:13:50.340 --> 00:14:01.139
Brady Lund: There's some favorite theories of mine like diffusion of innovations which is really useful. And there's some important figures. And I tried to pick a variety of figures from different countries, contexts.

96
00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.440
Brady Lund: and different contributions they make to our discipline.

97
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.019
Brady Lund: So that is an overview of our 1st assignment.

98
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:22.017
Brady Lund: If you have any questions, of course, feel free to email me, contact me. We can always set up a Zoom Meeting if you need me to walk through something. I'm more than happy to help. Just be sure not to wait until the very last minute to ask for help.

99
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:27.209
Brady Lund: or I might not be available on Sunday evening, for instance. So

100
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:31.359
Brady Lund: please feel free to reach out to me during the week. If you see any questions

101
00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:37.480
Brady Lund: other than that, I'll look forward to seeing you again next week, and have a great rest of your week.

102
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:38.570
Brady Lund: Bye-bye.
