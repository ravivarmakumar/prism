00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:11.180
Brady Lund: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Module 4 Module 4 is information organization, which

2
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.399
Brady Lund: happens to be one of the classes that I regularly teach at the graduate level.

3
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.400
Brady Lund: I will say it's not necessarily the most

4
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:27.460
Brady Lund: a thrilling, exciting topic to talk about, but in my personal opinion at least. But it is an important

5
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.640
Brady Lund: concept within information science, obviously so, a very important one to talk about here in our course as well.

6
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.249
Brady Lund: So what is information organization?

7
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:51.379
Brady Lund: Well, if you think back to what we've been talking about over the past couple of weeks, we have these large stores of resources. We may have a library with

8
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.850
Brady Lund: a million books, for instance.

9
00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:02.109
Brady Lund: Well, we can't just take in new resources. We can't just take any new book and put it wherever

10
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.109
Brady Lund: there's a spot available on a shelf, because if somebody comes along later on and wants to be able to find that book.

11
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.490
Brady Lund: we're not going to know where we placed it.

12
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.599
Brady Lund: So. Information organization is a collection of principles or systems to

13
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.870
Brady Lund: organize these resources in a logical way, so that we can then retrieve them.

14
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.619
Brady Lund: Retrieval or retrieving being a term that we'll discuss more next week.

15
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.819
Brady Lund: actually going and finding the resources we need based off an information need.

16
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.369
Brady Lund: So we're developing systems in order to arrange and organize our objects

17
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.039
Brady Lund: so that we can go and find them later on.

18
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.139
Brady Lund: I give the example of a library, but you can also think about retrieval of

19
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:59.619
Brady Lund: other documents, or even data sets arranged in a collection arranged in the database.

20
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:12.929
Brady Lund: Obviously, we don't just want to. If we have a collection of data files. Just store them with random numbers as as their titles. You know, this is file one. This is File 2,

21
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:21.790
Brady Lund: because we're not going to know what file number has the actual data set that we're looking for? We need to have more descriptors.

22
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.920
Brady Lund: more information, more what we call metadata or data describing our resources in order to be able to find the data sets that we need.

23
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:44.520
Brady Lund: So this requires a pretty detailed organizational structure. We need to be able to identify one specific resource, one specific document.

24
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.499
Brady Lund: one specific data set out of a collection of potentially millions of resources. So each resource

25
00:02:51.770 --> 00:03:07.879
Brady Lund: must have a unique identifier that sets it apart from all other resources. So we can find that resource that we need and must have some kind of ability to show relationships among these different resources so that you can see resources that are related to one another.

26
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:22.630
Brady Lund: All the resources in a specific subject area, for instance. So when we're talking about information organization, we're arranging large collections of information. We must have logical ways to do this. So we can find the specific resource that we need.

27
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.199
Brady Lund: So let's talk a bit about metadata, metadata, or metadata.

28
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:37.750
Brady Lund: I'm not picky about how you pronounce it. The most important thing to know is that this is literally data about data.

29
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.700
Brady Lund: So in other words.

30
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:51.790
Brady Lund: we discuss data when talking about the data information, knowledge, wisdom, pyramid, right? The Di Kw, pyramid data is

31
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.010
Brady Lund: any kind of symbols stimulus, anything that can help us

32
00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.669
Brady Lund: understand the world as we make sense of it as we add meaning to it to turn into information.

33
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:12.019
Brady Lund: Metadata describes data. It also describes information in the case of actual organized resources as well.

34
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.200
Brady Lund: But what it's telling us is it's providing us information about the attributes

35
00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:33.310
Brady Lund: of our documents, of our data, of our information in order to be able to differentiate one resource from another, and in order to describe or provide some information about that resource that can help us distinguish one from another.

36
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:43.779
Brady Lund: So you can see in this immature example, if we had a cat as our data. In this case our metadata could be things like

37
00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:48.468
Brady Lund: file name for the photo of that cat.

38
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:59.739
Brady Lund: who took a photo of the cat where they took it when they took it. For a cat itself. If a cat was the actual data that we're organizing, if we have like

39
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.050
Brady Lund: a collection of cats, or we had like animals at a zoo, or something of that sort.

40
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:14.889
Brady Lund: what type of animal is it? What breed. What is its age? What name have we given the animal? Where is it located? Within this arrangement?

41
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:29.560
Brady Lund: Metadata describes these attributes to distinguish one from another? It's not really focused on the content of what is it? So we're not going to be providing like a hundred page paper on what is a cap

42
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:36.370
Brady Lund: that's not metadata, but metadata is describing at a broad level. What is this thing?

43
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:43.679
Brady Lund: It's a cat. What kind of breed of cat is it so that we can distinguish, said Cat, from a dog.

44
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.139
Brady Lund: from a different breed of cat.

45
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.980
Brady Lund: from a person, from a book, from a rock. We're distinguishing these things from one another.

46
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.699
Brady Lund: So there are several types of metadata

47
00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:02.390
Brady Lund: to think about. Descriptive metadata is describing the content of a document or for resource.

48
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:10.919
Brady Lund: So if we think in the case of books, things like title, author, keywords that's describing actual content. Who contributed to this book?

49
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.199
Brady Lund: Who's responsible for this book? What is this book? What is it about

50
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:23.630
Brady Lund: those kinds of things in a data set? What is this data about? What is it describing? What is this data from?

51
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:24.830
Brady Lund: Essentially.

52
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:45.780
Brady Lund: we have structural metadata. This is talking about the form of the actual document. So file formats edition of the book. So we may have a data store where we're including files in a variety of different formats. Maybe we have some Csv files. We have some Json files. We have

53
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.060
Brady Lund: a variety of different formats. Well.

54
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.049
Brady Lund: our metadata may specify what formats of data we have available.

55
00:06:53.220 --> 00:07:09.239
Brady Lund: Because if you think about it from the person coming and looking for data sets, maybe I want to use data that's only organized in a certain format. If that's the case, then that's an important information aspect that I want to know before I make a decision whether or not to use that resource

56
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:16.390
Brady Lund: and finally, administrative metadata. That's like the technical details of the resource. Who created this

57
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:37.470
Brady Lund: metadata. When did they create it. That's important, because we may have a case where I've created a metadata record. I've described this cat in our little database here so that you can distinguish it from all the other cats, but maybe I made a mistake, or maybe it's outdated. Maybe the cat died, or something.

58
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:47.350
Brady Lund: Well, I need to then go and update the metadata to indicate the cat is dead. You're not actually going to be able to find it right? So there's a distinction there as well.

59
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:53.899
Brady Lund: and that needs to be made in our metadata so that we can have accurate information about our resources

60
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.010
Brady Lund: cataloging when we talk about

61
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:09.020
Brady Lund: the process of creating and entering metadata, creating these records within a library type context. Then we're talking about the job of a cataloger

62
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.209
Brady Lund: catalog you

63
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:18.170
Brady Lund: is the process of creating these records in order to support the retrieval of documents. So the process of

64
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.309
Brady Lund: identifying what metadata to enter and then how to enter it.

65
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:34.080
Brady Lund: When we are doing this, we typically follow a set of standardized formats. So cataloging, they're going to follow

66
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:46.519
Brady Lund: a set guidelines in terms of how to identify. For instance, what subject are we going to enter? What format are we going to use to enter in the author, the subject, so on and so forth. So we're not just

67
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:53.609
Brady Lund: looking at an object and saying, Well, this is how I would describe it. So this is how I'm going to enter the metadata record.

68
00:08:53.750 --> 00:09:06.460
Brady Lund: We're going to follow a set of standards. We're going to follow a set list of possible subjects to enter, and we're going to use that to make suggestions or selections of what we would enter for the subject.

69
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:16.390
Brady Lund: So professional catalogers they're primarily working in between the actual documents themselves, whatever those are that the library collects

70
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:29.090
Brady Lund: and the systems where they're entering in the metadata. So they have to think about, how are the systems conceptualizing this metadata or using this metadata? How are users going to come and access

71
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.640
Brady Lund: resources by using this metadata? And then what is the actual resource about?

72
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.359
Brady Lund: And finally, we have classification schemes when we're talking about

73
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:51.910
Brady Lund: physical resources. They have call numbers classification numbers. And if you go to our libraries and you look around the stacks, our resources, you'll see. These have call numbers and call numbers.

74
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.750
Brady Lund: distinguish one resource from another. Within our library collections

75
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:15.009
Brady Lund: there are a variety of classification schemes that exist in libraries today. I'm not going to obviously go all over them here, and you aren't expected to, either. These are more specific to different types of libraries. But the important thing to note

76
00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:38.300
Brady Lund: when we talk about classification schemes in this class? Is there ways to differentiate or provide a unique identifier to each resource within a collection distinguishing one book from another. Each book is going to have a distinct call number to distinguish it from all other books. Even if we were talking about something like a collection of data sets a collection of

77
00:10:38.410 --> 00:11:07.460
Brady Lund: photographs in artworks in a museum, for instance, each item that we have in our collection is going to have a unique call number, which the specific purpose of this call number is not to tell us anything about what's in the book necessarily, but to distinguish one book from another, distinguish one resource from another. It is simply used as a reference in order to be able to determine and distinguish one resource from another.

78
00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:13.140
Brady Lund: So this is an overview of information organization.

79
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:29.560
Brady Lund: We do have a Discussion board guided readings on these topics, and then a. Qqr. For this week, as always, please feel free to reach out to me. If you have any questions I'm available to support you. That is my job. So do not hesitate to reach out.

80
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:33.250
Brady Lund: and I will be happy to chat with you further.

81
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:37.669
Brady Lund: Have a great rest of your day, and I'll talk to you again soon.
