A vague question is:
- Too broad or general (e.g., "tell me about the course" without specifics) AND has no context in conversation history
- Ambiguous (could mean multiple things) AND the conversation history doesn't clarify it
- Missing important context that makes it impossible to answer EVEN AFTER checking conversation history
- Unclear intent AND conversation history doesn't help

NOT vague (these should pass through):
- Simple greetings (hello, hi, hey, greetings) - these are clear social interactions
- Direct questions (what is X, how does Y work, explain Z, etc.)
- Specific queries about topics, concepts, or course material
- Questions with clear intent even if brief
- Questions that use pronouns/references (like "the paper", "it", "they") IF the conversation history provides the referent
- Questions that can be answered using conversation context (e.g., if history mentions "NeuroQuest paper", then "who are the authors of the paper?" is NOT vague)
- Module-related queries (e.g., "explain module 2", "what is in module 1", "tell me about module 3") - these are clear requests for module content

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS check the conversation history FIRST before marking a question as vague
- If the conversation history provides context that clarifies pronouns/references, the question is NOT vague
- Be lenient - only mark as vague if the question is truly unanswerable even with conversation context

Respond with valid JSON only: {"is_vague": true/false, "follow_up_questions": ["question1", "question2"]}"""
            
            user_prompt = f"""Conversation History:
{conversation_history if conversation_history else "No previous conversation"}

Current Question: "{query}"

STEP 1: Check the conversation history above. Look for:
- Any mentions of papers, documents, topics, or entities that could be referenced
- Previous questions and answers that provide context
- Any specific names or terms that pronouns/references might refer to

STEP 2: Analyze if this question is vague:
- If it's a simple greeting (hello, hi, hey), it is NOT vague - set is_vague to false.
- If it's a direct question (what is X, how does Y, explain Z), it is NOT vague.
- If the question uses pronouns or references (like "the paper", "it", "they", "this", "the authors"):
  * FIRST check if the conversation history provides a clear referent
  * If history mentions "NeuroQuest paper" and question is "who are the authors of the paper?", it is NOT vague
  * If history mentions a topic and question references "it", it is NOT vague
  * Only mark as vague if NO referent exists in the conversation history
- If the conversation history provides ANY context that makes the question answerable, it is NOT vague
- Only mark as vague if the question is truly ambiguous AND the conversation history doesn't help

EXAMPLES:
- History: "What is NeuroQuest?" Answer: "NeuroQuest is a paper about..." Question: "Who are the authors of the paper?" → NOT vague (paper = NeuroQuest)
- History: "Tell me about the agents" Answer: "There are 3 agents..." Question: "What are they?" → NOT vague (they = agents)
- History: None, Question: "Who are the authors of the paper?" → VAGUE (no referent)

If it is vague, provide ONLY ONE follow-up question at a time that will help clarify the query. Ask the most important question first. If not vague, set follow_up_questions to an empty array."""
